# Working Code Solutions For:

## ADC

For storing analog voltages as 8 bit values.

## I2C

For interfacing with different sensors (i.e. VL6180X Prox)

## Input Capture

For handling input from retroreflective sensor.

## Timers

For keeping track of timings & event triggering.

## CAN

Right now can exists as a means to send CAN messages back and forth but does not have support for anything else.

## LED Shield

Great for debugging.

## USB Serial / UART

Even better for debugging. Console output over USB.
